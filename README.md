# HCAHPS-Hospital-Consumer-Assessment-of-Healthcare-Providers-and-Systems-Analysis
This project is a data-driven analysis of hospital patient experience, using the HCAHPS dataset to uncover insights into satisfaction levels, response patterns, and performance across states and time periods. The analysis explores survey response rates, top-box scores, and state satisfaction indexes, highlighting areas of strong engagement and regions needing improvement.

Through interactive Power BI dashboards featuring KPIs, funnel charts, heat maps, treemaps, and gauge visuals, the project provides a clear view of patient feedback trends. These insights support data-informed decisions for improving patient care, increasing survey participation, and benchmarking hospital performance nationwide.
